This is an assignment for building a TV Series App using React, React Query, Framer Motion, Styled-components, and the TMDb API. The app will allow users to browse TV shows across three categories: Now Playing, Popular, and Top Rated. Additionally, users can view show details in a modal, with smooth animations created with Framer Motion for a more dynamic and interactive experience. Data is fetched efficiently using React Query, ensuring fast and seamless browsing.
